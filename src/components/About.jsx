      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a developer, with primarily Object Oriented Programming experience;
        however, I also have experience in using various cloud providers and databases.
        I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from George 
        Mason University with a concentration in Database and Programing. I have been 
        programming since I was in Highschool learning the fundamentals of Java and 
        Python and In My later college years I began learning Web development frameworks 
        as well as cloud principles. Currently I am looking for an employment opportunity
        that will help me grow my skills and knowledge as a Developer.</p>
