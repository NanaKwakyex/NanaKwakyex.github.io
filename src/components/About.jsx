      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring Fullstack Developer, with cloud experience, primarily 
        with Amamzon Web services but some Google Cloud as well. I am currently
        an Information Technology student at George Mason University with a projected
        concentration in Database and Programing. I have been programming since 
        I was in Highschool as I wanted to learn game development, moving from
        a game community Byond, which used a C-like language called "dream maker",
        to Java and Python. Within My later college years I began learning Web development
        languages and frameworks as well as cloud principles. Currently I am expected to 
        graduate with a bachelor's in Spring 2024.</p>
